                    Keybot ia a robotics team that proudly represents Mexico internationally in the First Robotics Competition, but beyond that, we are a family and community that expands and develops day by day. 

                    The name of our team Keybot, means "the key to knowledge towards science, technology and engineering". Originally designed with the values instilled by our institution and of course the FIRST competition.

                    We have been a part of the FRC community since 2015, which is why our presence has been acknowledged for 6 straight seasons, where we have fiercely competed and represented everything our mentors have taught us throughout the years.
